One interesting I learned about was how the internet delivers 'packets' through a 'wired' communication system that is overseen by 'protocols' - TCP/IP.
I also realized that there is a correlation between phone numbers and IP addresses. IP addresses help one machine find another machine through the varied paths it travels. We are running out of IP addresses.
The path that information travels along the internet is as follows - a request goes out to a network and goes through Domain Name Servers and finds the target server using IP addresses. 
A big question I have is how does the internet process and delivers requests in such high speeds considering it has to be pieced back together again.
