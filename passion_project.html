My passion project is a social media networking site for activists around the world. Activists with related work will be connected to each other as well as a built in calendar of events aound important conferences/events worldwide. There is also a video blog page where users can share important work they are doing and have others collaborate, donate, and reshare on other social media networks. The site also has a feature where users can sign petitions, make donations directly to outside orgs.
